## Limitations:
* There are many limitations in this analysis because it yet to give in-dept insights about itemization and which champions can pair up with others thanks to their unique interact with each other.
* The analysis also lack data integrity because many players might not public their personal matches so some champions might have a slightly higher win rate than other champsions.
* The dataset synthesized information from different rank levels so many champions might not be the best for certain rank to use because the skill ceiling of them might be too high.


## Outcome:

Based on the analysis conducted, a newly introduced champion named Briar, designated for the "Jungle" role, demonstrates an unexpectedly high win-rate coupled with a notable ban-rate. This suggests that her performance significantly surpasses that of other champions within the League of Legends roster.
